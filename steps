<TO DO>
  What to do if artist/genre/year has not been entered? There should be a standard!
  From input --> JSON and retrieve the relevant info, fixed!
  From relevant info --> array, fixed!
  Perform a search query on the artists, fixed!
  Solo artist? fixed!
  Band / 2+ artists? need to be fixed, check with music ontology!

Before every q there should be the following: https://api.spotify.com/v1/search? !!!!
